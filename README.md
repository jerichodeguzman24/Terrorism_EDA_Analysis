# Terrorism_EDA_Analysis
This is an exploratory data analysis of the Global Terrorism Database, with the aim of identifying hot zones of terrorism and gaining insights into the security issues associated with terrorism. The dataset contains information on terrorist incidents around the world, including the type of attack, location, date, and other relevant details.

The analysis was conducted using Python programming language and various data wrangling and visualization libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. The data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers. Exploratory data analysis techniques were employed to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Please refer to my code for my insights and recommendations.

I chose this task to showcase my talent and skills in performing EDA using Python for my internship at The Sparks Foundation Data Science and Business Analytics program.
